                <p>According to a January article by <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">Student Loan Planner</a>, <a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank">Navient Corporation</a> has been “mired in a growing number of lawsuits” since 2017. But how has that affected student loan borrowers in Maryland, specifically? According to data from the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=All&date_received_max=2024-11-20&date_received_min=2011-12-01&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=issue&tab=Trends" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, Maryland residents’ complaints averaged around 6,000 between 2017 and 2019. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Maryland’s Navient complaints saw an uptick, with the number increasing to over 9,500 cases in the year. This number would continue to climb exponentially; in 2021 the number of complaints broke five digits, with a total of over 14,000 and in 2023, the number of complaints reached over 32,000. Through Nov. 20 in 2024, the number of complaints has continued to skyrocket, with an increase of 25,000 from 2023 already being logged with over a month left in the year.</p>

                However, compared to states with similar populations - Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Colorado - Maryland’s number of Navient complaints are shockingly high. Despite its population being in the middle of the 5 states, its number of complaints led the charts by a relatively large margin every year since 2017. However, it took until 2021 for Maryland’s numbers to truly begin to pull away, with nearly 9,000 more complaints than the next highest total. Although all of these states have followed the same trend of increasing complaints in recent years, none have compared to Maryland’s meteoric rise. So far in 2024, Maryland’s gap on the rest of the data set has continued to grow, with the total number of complaints in the year reaching nearly 26,000 more than the next closest state, Indiana.
