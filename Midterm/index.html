                    The Big Ten did send a team to the Final Four for the first time since the pandemic hit, but its national title drought stretched closer to a quarter-decade as Purdue came up short against UConn. So we ask again: Is this the season for a breakthrough? On paper, the league’s strength is more its depth of quality teams (all 18 could conceivably be top-75 teams) than its top-tier title contenders, but March is unpredictable. Here’s a top-to-bottom look at the conference and which teams could rise above the rest.

                <p>Even with Zach Edey off to the NBA, Purdue is the safe choice to win the conference yet again. The Boilermakers have the league’s best coach in Matt Painter and its best point guard in Braden Smith, a combination that’s as good a place to start as any if building a team from scratch. Smith’s game may be more difficult without Edey attracting attention down low, but the Boilermakers can surround him with tons of shooting and a pair of dynamic wing athletes in Camden Heide and Myles Colvin. Plus, Trey Kaufman-Renn seems primed for a breakout stepping out of Edey’s shadow at center.</p>

                <p>Few rosters are more interesting nationally than the one built by Brad Underwood this offseason. He added a pair of potential first-round picks in Lithuanian PG Kasparas Jakucionis and Canadian wing Will Riley, though both are just 18 years old. In the portal, the Illini stocked up on positional size and shooting, most notably landing Evansville transfer forward Ben Humrichous. The center spot is a concern with freshmen Morez Johnson Jr. and Tomislav Ivisic expected to step into major roles, and there’s a ton of reliance overall here on guys who’ve never played college basketball. But if everything clicks, watch out … and Underwood has proven he’s good at finding the right buttons to press to maximize his personnel.</p>

                <p>With the amount the Hoosiers spent to rebuild this roster in the offseason, there are no excuses if Mike Woodson can’t win big with this group. Keeping Mackenzie Mgbako and Malik Reneau after rumors of a mass exodus was huge, but the story of the offseason was really the Hoosiers’ portal additions, namely Arizona transfer big Oumar Ballo and Washington State transfer PG Myles Rice. With that duo, IU now has a dynamic ball-screen creator and a dominant interior presence, plus plenty of talent on the wings. But Woodson has a lot to prove after last season’s debacle, and how he modernizes his offensive philosophy will dictate whether this season is a success.</p>

                <p>Jake Diebler had a positive first offseason as head coach of the Buckeyes, adding a pair of former elite recruits up front in Sean Stewart (Duke) and Aaron Bradshaw (Kentucky) as well as experience in the backcourt (South Carolina transfer Meechie Johnson Jr., San Diego State transfer Micah Parrish). That, combined with retaining Bruce Thornton, gives this group upward mobility in this crowded conference. Bradshaw feels like the swing piece, a toolsy 7-footer who had an uneven first season at Kentucky. If he can be more consistent as a shooter and improve on the defensive end, he might be a first-round pick by this time next year.</p>

                <p>After last season’s 15-loss campaign, the Spartans have now lost 13 or more games in four consecutive seasons. Part of that can be attributed to the grueling nonconference schedules Tom Izzo annually signs up for, but it’s certainly an indicator the Spartan program has fallen some from the elite status it maintained for most of the prior two decades under Izzo. The pieces that can change are part of a talented sophomore class, one that features PG of the future Jeremy Fears Jr., uber-athletic wing Coen Carr and skilled big Xavier Booker. Those three pieces showing progress may be even more important than the win-loss column for the Spartans in 2024–25.</p>

The Hawkeyes also got more athletic with transfer forward Seydou Traore, and watch out for a breakout year from junior wing Josh Dix, who scored 13 or more points in six of Iowa’s final nine games a year ago.</p>

                <p>The Wolverines winning the Dusty May sweepstakes this offseason was a huge coup for the program, and May built a competitive roster essentially from scratch in the spring.

There are questions from a spacing and defensive standpoint, though Wolf’s mobility and passing ability allow the Wolverines to do some creative things with him. In the backcourt, Ohio State transfer Roddy Gayle Jr. needs to take the next step into being a consistent shooter to carry this guard unit.</p>

                <p>Danny Sprinkle did yeoman’s work at Utah State a year ago and is one of the brightest young coaches in the sport, so it wouldn’t surprise anyone if he overachieves yet again. But outside of $2 million man Great Osobor, there are plenty of question marks with this group. Butler transfer DJ Davis gives this backcourt some scoring pop, but point guard play is a significant question mark. Osobor was one of the most impactful frontcourt players in the country last season at Utah State, but how his game scales up against bigger, more physical Big Ten foes may dictate whether this group goes dancing.</p>

                <p>History suggests Wisconsin will outperform this admittedly pessimistic outlook, but talent-wise this roster on paper belongs near the bottom of the Big Ten. The biggest reason for excitement is some of the Badgers’ young talent, namely guards John Blackwell and Daniel Freitag as well as big Nolan Winter. That trio combined with vets Steven Crowl and Max Klesmit and a trio of floor-raising portal additions give the Badgers a fighting chance at an NCAA tournament bid despite losing Chucky Hepburn and AJ Storr to the portal.</p>

                <p>The Gophs made tangible strides a year ago in a make-or-break season for Ben Johnson, but got ravaged by portal and draft departures this spring. Keeping Dawson Garcia was a big win though, as was the addition of Charlotte transfer Lu’Cye Patterson to replace Elijah Hawkins at point guard. This is an old team, with 10 of 13 scholarship players in at least their fourth college season, and they’ll need to lean on that experience to scrap out Big Ten wins with less talent than much of the league.</p>
