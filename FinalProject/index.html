                    In 2012, University of Maryland’s then-president Wallace Loh announced that the Terrapins would be switching athletic conferences from the Atlantic Coast Conference to the Big Ten, beginning in the fall of 2014  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was considered a controversial move at the time - Maryland was a founding member of the ACC back in 1952 and the Terrapins had built strong rivalries with other schools such as Duke and North Carolina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One decade later, the sentiment around fans is largely the same: “The Terps should have stayed in the ACC.” One look at a comment section of any Maryland losing “Final” graphic on <a href="https://x.com/SoundMoneyG/status/1863001236888232120" target="_blank">social media</a> will confirm this sentiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how has Maryland’s B1G move truly stack up to its years in the ACC. Should the Terps really have stayed in the ACC? Or was the move to the Big Ten actually worth it?

                <h4><strong>The Method</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    I took a look at the past 50 years of athletic performance of 10 different sports to answer this question. The sports I examined were: baseball, softball, men’s and women’s basketball, men’s and women’s lacrosse, men’s and women’s soccer, football and field hockey. From there, I derived a point-based ranking system to measure success through a quantifiable value, called Success Score, for each of these 10 teams in each of the past five decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not every sport uses the same format for its NCAA tournaments (if they even have one…), meaning these point comparisons are not completely one-to-one. However, each variation of the point system follows a similar structure, giving us a reliable indicator to measure success.
                </p>
                <p>The point system is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>+20 points for each NCAA Championship won</li>
                    <li>+15 points for each appearance in the NCAA Championship game</li>
                    <li>+10 points for each appearance as a final four team in the NCAA Tournament</li>
                    <li>+8 points for each appearance as a top-eight team in the NCAA Tournament (equivalent to a New Year's Six or BCS Bowl win in football)</li>
                    <li>+6 points for each appearance as a top-16 team in the NCAA Tournament (for smaller tournaments, an appearance as a seeded team is used instead. Also, for football, a standard Bowl Game win is equivalent for this category)</li>
                    <li>+5 points for an NCAA Tournament appearance (Bowl Game appearance for football)</li>
                    <li>+4 points for winning a conference championship (or a championship game for football)</li>
                    <li>+2 points for having the best regular-season in-conference record</li>
                    <li>+1 point for having a winning record in conference play</li>
                </ul>

                    Starting with the Big Ten decade, there are three sports, men’s and women’s lacrosse and field hockey, that have set the standard for what Maryland Big Ten success looks like. Although the women’s lacrosse team has won three national championships compared to the men’s lacrosse team’s two, the men’s team narrowly edges out the women due to their ability to make deep runs into NCAA tournaments a bit more frequently than their female counterparts. A distant third is field hockey. Although they’ve qualified for the NCAA Tournament eight times and made the finals twice, the team failed to win a national championship during this decade. The other team to win a national championship during this Big Ten era is the men’s soccer team, who took home the hardware in 2018. However, the team did not have sustained success outside of that playoff run, landing them in the middle of the pack for this decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, the softball and women’s soccer teams have struggled in the past decade. Both barely register on the chart. Softball weighs in with a Success Score of two thanks to two winning conference records, while women’s soccer sits right behind with a score of one, thanks to a singular winning season in-conference of their own.

                    Now for Maryland’s ACC years. As a whole, Maryland’s best decade in the ACC was from 2004-2014. During this decade, the selected Maryland teams claimed 10 national championships, of which field hockey contributed to half. This decade is also the only one where three separate teams (women’s lacrosse, men’s soccer and field hockey) all registered with Success Scores higher than 300. Additionally, even the worst teams of this decade - baseball and softball - managed to find some success, registering with Success Scores above the single-digits.

                    The decade before, 1994-2004, is largely defined once again by women’s lacrosse, who won seven consecutive national titles during this era. This dominance gives the 1995-2004 women’s lacrosse team the single highest Success Score out of any team in any decade of this study, with a score of 476, which edges out the 2004-2013 field hockey team’s score of 448. Field hockey does chip in to the success this decade with another championship of their own. Men’s basketball also enjoyed their best success during this decade, winning their first and only national championship during this time.

                    The two preceding decades see a sharp decline in success. Although Maryland’s powerhouses, women’s lacrosse and field hockey both still deliver two national titles each, their Success Scores are lower than usual, primarily due to the smaller conferences and shortened NCAA Tournament formats of these sports, which were still in their infancy during this time.

                    The final decade of the study, 1974-1984, is the worst decade for Maryland athletics overall. With both women’s lacrosse and field hockey in their very early years of competition, the onus falls on men’s lacrosse to carry the Terps, who won the Terps’ only national title of this era in 1975. Additionally, this is the only era where Maryland football showed something above mediocrity, when the Terps recorded a winning conference record every year and frequently qualified for Bowl Games. However, their inability to win these games still keeps the team from reaching a triple-digit Success Score.

                <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    So how does the Big Ten decade stack up to the decades that came before it? When averaging the point totals for each sport per decade, the results come to: 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>2004-2014 with an average Success Score of 174.3</li>
                    <li>1994-2004 with an average Success Score of 146.4</li>
                    <li><em>2014-2024 with an average Success Score of 141.3</em></li>
                    <li>1984-1994 with an average Success Score of 84.67</li>
                    <li>1974-1984 with an average Success Score of 63.75</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note: Softball began play in 1995 and was not included in the average Success Scores for 1984-1994 and 1974-1984. Women’s soccer began play in 1987 and was not included in the average Success Score for 1974-1984.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, the Big Ten decade ranks right in the middle of the study. While this mediocrity is not bad, it still ranks below the two decades in the ACC that preceded it. The last time the Terps’ success was this low was prior to 1994, when many of its modern-day powerhouses were still developing. Based on this data alone, it appears that the switch in conferences has <strong>NOT</strong> been worth it for the Terps. And with the new addition of Oregon, Washington, UCLA and USC to the Big Ten, the competition in the conference just got even tougher.
